== Requirements
Here are the requirements we have compiled for the following:

=== Input/Output
1. Input Voltage: 100-240V AC, 50-60 Hz
2. Output Voltage: 5V and 9V with maximum output current of 2.4A and 1.67A respectively

=== Plug
1. The plug should fit well in the socket to prevent it from being accidentally pulled out.
2. The plug needs to be sturdy enough to endure being inserted and removed from the socket several times.
3. There should be no sharp edges or other metal protrusions on the plug that might cause an electrical shock.
4. The plug needs to be safe by the standards of the market it’s destined for, such as BIS in India.

=== Safety Features
1. Over-voltage, over-current, and short-circuit protection.
2. FCC, CE, RoHS, and UL certification for safety and quality assurance.
3. Energy efficiency compliance with Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) standards.
4. High resistance in a circuit may cause other parts to overheat and fail. To be safe, we should aim for a temperature of 45°C or less while operating at full capacity.
5. There should be good insulation from interference, voltage surges and electrical noise. PP/PE insulation is the standard norm.

=== Cable
1. A cable length of 90 cm would be suitable, as it allows for more flexibility in positioning the charger and the phone while charging.
2. The length of the cable can affect the safety and the thermodynamics of wire heating. Longer cables generally have more resistance than shorter cables, which can lead to an increase in the amount of heat generated during charging. This can be a safety concern, as excessive heat can damage the charger, the cable, and the device being charged.
3. The potential of a short circuit or other electrical hazards increases with cable length, which is already more vulnerable to physical damage and wear and tear.
4. Use only cables and chargers that have been certified as safe by the appropriate authorities and only for their intended use to reduce the potential for harm. That means not just ensuring the cable isn’t frayed or broken, but also utilising the suitable cable for the device.
5. Thermodynamic considerations for wire heating should be made while designing both the cable and the charger to ensure maximum charging efficiency and to reduce the amount of heat created by the cable and the charger.

=== Connector
1. Type-C USB connector for charging newer models of mobile phones after Dec 31, 2024, as it will become the standard in India.
2. Connector should have fast charging capability.
3. The connector should conform to current specifications for charging mobile devices.

=== Exterior Body
1. We should keep the size of the charger to be 10 cm in length and 4 cm in width for easy portability as well as light in weight.
2. The charger should also be able to withstand sudden impacts, such as falling on the ground, without damage to the inner circuit.

== Specifications
=== Charger Cable
Requirements of a USB type C Cable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A USB Type-C charging cable must meet certain requirements in order to be compliant with the USB Type-C specifications. These requirements include:

. Connector Type: The cable must have a Type-C connector on one end and a USB Type-C connector on the other end.
. Pin Assignments: The cable must be wired according to the USB Type-C pin assignments, which include power and ground pins, data pins, and configuration pins.
. Cable Length:.we will use cable of length 1m.
. Voltage and Current Rating: The cable must be rated for a voltage of 20V and a current of 5A.
. Cable Impedance: The cable impedance should be 90 Ohm.
. Connector Dimensions: The Type-C connector should be 8.4 mm wide and 2.6 mm thick.
. Contact Resistance: The contact resistance of the Type-C connector should be less than or equal to 20 mOhm.
. Insertion/Retention Force: The insertion force for a Type-C connector is 10N maximum, and the retention force is 7 N minimum.
. Data transfer: The cable should support data transfer up to 10 Gbps.
. Power Delivery: The cable should support power delivery up to 100W.
. Audio/Video: The cable should not support audio/video signal transmission.
. EMI/RFI Shielding: The cable should be shielded to protect against electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI).
. Cable jacket: The cable jacket should be made of durable and flexible materials that can withstand repeated bending and twisting.
. Compliance: The cable must comply with the USB Type-C specifications and be certified by the USB-IF (USB Implementers Forum).
. Cable gauge: The copper wire diameter used in the cable affects the charging speed and power delivery capability, typically 26 or 28 gauge copper wire is used in Type-C cables.
The diameter of the copper wire used in a Type-C mobile charging cable is typically around 0.5-1.0 mm.
The diameter and thickness of the insulating PVC used to cover the wires of a Type-C charging cable can vary between different cables. The PVC diameter usually ranges from 4 to 7 mm, while the thickness can range from 0.5 to 1.5 mm .In general, the PVC should provide adequate insulation to protect the wires while also allowing the cable to be flexible and durable.

Manufacturing process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The manufacturing process of a Type-C USB cable involves several steps:

. Raw materials procurement: The first step is to acquire the raw materials required for the cable, such as copper wire, PVC insulation, and the Type-C connector.
. Stranding: The copper wire is then stranded together to form the conductors of the cable. The number of wires used and the way they are stranded together will depend on the desired specifications of the cable, such as its thickness and flexibility.
. Insulation: The stranded wires are then coated with PVC insulation to protect them and prevent electrical interference.
. Connector assembly: The Type-C connector is then assembled, which involves inserting the conductors into the connector and soldering them in place.
. Cable assembly: The insulated conductors are then inserted into the PVC jacket and the connector is attached to one end of the cable.
. Testing: The cable is then tested to ensure that it meets the required specifications and standards. This includes testing for continuity, insulation resistance, and electrical safety.
. Packaging: The final step is to package the cable for shipment to customers.

Standards & Compliances for  a USB type-C Cable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The detailed standards and regulations for a Type-C USB cable include:
[start=1]
. USB 3.1 specification: This specification defines the physical and electrical characteristics of the Type-C connector and cable. It covers the pin assignments, connector dimensions, and cable assembly requirements for the Type-C connector.
. USB Type-C Cable and Connector Specification: This specification defines the requirements for Type-C cables, including the maximum cable length, voltage and current rating, and cable impedance. It also defines the requirements for the Type-C connector, including the connector dimensions, contact resistance, and insertion/retention force.
. USB Power Delivery Specification: This specification defines the requirements for power delivery over a USB Type-C cable, including the maximum power level of 100W and the various power profiles that a cable should support.
. USB-IF Compliance Testing Program: This program is run by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) and includes a series of tests that a Type-C cable must pass in order to be compliant with the USB-IF standards.
. Safety Standards: The cable must comply with safety standards such as UL, CE, FCC, and RoHS. These standards ensure that the cable is safe to use and does not pose any hazards to the user.
. EMC Standards: The cable must comply with the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) standards for cables, which ensure that the cable does not cause interference with other electronic devices.
. Environmental Regulations: The cable must comply with environmental regulations such as REACH, WEEE, and RoHS. These regulations ensure that the cable is made of materials that are safe for the environment and that it can be recycled or disposed of safely.
Country-specific regulations: Depending on the country where the cable is sold, it might be required to comply with additional regulations and standards.


Materials Required
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The materials required in the manufacturing process of a USB Type-C cable include:

. Copper wire: The cable core is made of copper wire, which is responsible for the electrical conductivity of the cable. The copper wire is typically stranded and coated with a layer of insulation to prevent short-circuiting.
. Insulation materials: The insulation materials are used to coat the copper wire to prevent short-circuiting and to protect the wire from physical damage. The insulation materials can be made of PVC, TPE, rubber, or other materials.
. Shielding materials: Shielding materials are used to protect the cable from electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI). The shielding materials can be made of aluminum foil, braided wire, or other materials.
. Connectors: The connectors are the parts of the cable that connect to the devices. The connectors can be made of plastic or metal and typically have metal contacts for electrical connectivity.
 Cable jacket: The cable jacket is the outer layer of the cable that protects the other components from physical damage. The cable jacket can be made of PVC, TPE, rubber, or other materials.
. Adhesive materials: Adhesive materials are used to hold the various components of the cable together and to ensure that the cable is durable.
. Labels, Markings and Packaging: The cable is often labeled with the manufacturer's information, certifications, and other information, and is packaged for distribution.

Pricing
^^^^^^^
. Copper wire: The price of copper wire can range from $2 to $5 per pound.(360 - 900 Rs/kg). This will roughly cost us 10 -11 Rs. (considering 1m length wire and 4 copper wires with diameter 1mm)
. Insulation materials and cable jackets: The price of insulation materials and cable jackets, such as PVC or TPE, can range from $0.5 to $1 per pound (90 - 180 Rs/kg).
This will cost us roughly 5 - 6 Rs (considering 1m length and inner radius of 2.5 mm and thickness 1 mm )
. Shielding materials: The price of shielding materials, such as aluminum foil or braided wire, can range from $1 to $2 per pound.(180 - 360 Rs/kg) This will cost us roughly 5 - 6 Rs.
. Connectors: The price of connectors can range from $0.1 to $0.5 per piece, depending on the type and quality of the connector. (18 - 90 Rs/kg)
. Adhesive materials: The price of adhesive materials can range from $0.05 to $0.1 per pound. (9 - 18 Rs/kg)
. Labels, Markings, and Packaging: The cost of labels, markings, and packaging can vary widely depending on the materials and methods used.
. Overall cost ~ around 25 - 30 Rs. (including additional costs of label, adhesive materials etc)

//  (~180 Rs/kg == 1 dollar / pound)
=== Charger Adapter
Shape and Size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Rectangular body (Box shape) with rounded corners.
. The body will have a length of 7.5 cm, a width of 4.5 cm, and a depth of 2cm.

Materials
^^^^^^^^
The main body of a mobile phone charger is typically made of plastic or metal.

Plastic is a popular choice because it is lightweight, inexpensive, and can be easily molded into various shapes and sizes. ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is a commonly used plastic material for the main body of a mobile phone charger, as it is durable and has good heat resistance. Hence, we will use ABS for making our chargers due to the above factors.

Colour
^^^^^^

. Typically, we have chargers in black and white colors.
. We can make chargers in different colors too, like red, yellow, etc.

Standards
^^^^^^^^^
The battery charger should be designed according to IEEE-1547, SAE-J2894, and similar standards such that the amount of harmonic and dc current injected into the utility grid must be controlled within the preset limit.

There are several standards that mobile phone chargers must adhere to in order to ensure safe and efficient charging of devices. Some of the most important standards include:
[start=1]
. USB Charging: The USB (Universal Serial Bus) standard is widely used for charging mobile phones and other devices. USB chargers typically provide 5V of power and can deliver up to 2.5 watts (500 mA) of current.
. USB Power Delivery (USB-PD): USB-PD is a newer standard that allows for higher power charging up to 100 watts. This standard allows for faster charging and also supports charging of laptops and other devices.

These are the most common standards in the market, but there are others such as the European Union's Energy-related Products (ErP) Directive, which limits the standby power consumption of devices, and the safety standards like UL, CE and FCC.

Our charger body should be compatible with these standards and should be safe to use at these specifications.

Prices
^^^^^^
The material we are using for charging is ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene), and the approximate weight of one charger body will be around 20-25 grams. As of Jan’22 - Dec’22 the price of ABS is around 95-125 Rupees per Kg. So, considering the mass production of the charger body we can assume that we can make 30-35 charger bodies per Kg of ABS material. Hence, it will cost around 4 Rupees per charger body.

== Abstract
This report includes the requirements and specifications for the mobile charger designed by tribe CADMUS. We first compiled a list of requirements any commoner would expect from a mobile charger. Upon researching about the same, we trimmed our requirements to specifications we could actually incorporate. Major focus was to make our device accessible and future ready, keeping in mind the legalities involved. We ensured that our mobile charger was compatible with each standard and was safe to use at these specifications. We also kept in mind the prices of various raw materials used in the charger for our aim of catering to the masses.

== Motivation
Exploring the device that we use everyday was actually the fun part. Observing the intricacies and realising the simplicity of the charger was motivating. It was thrilling to implement the electrical circuits knowledge we gained in high school and first year. The mechanical team realised size limitation most companies are facing and balanced the tradeoff in compactness and efficiency. We have also added the scope of improvement that was result of extensive brainstorming among our enthusiastic members.

== Working
// 
A mobile charger is a device that converts AC (alternating current) power from a wall outlet into DC (direct current) power that can be used to charge the battery of a mobile phone. The following steps will explain how our mobile charger works:

//
1. The charger is plugged into an AC power outlet, which supplies the charger with the required voltage (220V AC, it can vary from 100-240V) and current to operate.

2. The AC input is then passed through a bridge rectifier which converts it to DC voltage. This rectifier has 4 HD06-T diodes with 2 terminals for the input and output signal.

3. The DC voltage then passed through a ripple remover which minimizes the AC ripples in the rectifier's output for a smoother output.

4. This DC voltage produced is passed to a flyback controller (UCC28730) which converts DC back to high frequency AC. The UCC28730 is an isolated-flyback power supply controller that uses primary-side winding sensing to offer precise voltage and constant current regulation, doing away with the need for opto-coupler feedback circuits. It's main components are the following:
a. _VS (Voltage Sense)_ - The VS pin is used to sense input voltage, output voltage, event timing, and Wait-state wake-up signaling. It is connected to a resistor-divider that runs from the auxiliary winding to ground. This pin also monitors the VS current produced through RS1 by the reflected bulk capacitor voltage during the MOSFET on-time in order to provide the AC-input Run and Stop thresholds and to adjust the current-sense threshold across the AC-input range.
b. _CS (Current Sense)_ - The current-sense pin is connected to the current-sense resistor by a series resistor (RLC, RCS). The maximum current-sense threshold (VCST(max)) for IPP(max) is roughly 0.74 V, and the minimum current-sense threshold (VCST(min)) for IPP is roughly 0.25 V (min).
c. _DRV (Gate Drive)_ - The DRV pin is connected to the MOSFET gate pin via a series resistor. A gate-drive signal with a 14 V maximum is provided by the gate driver.

5. After getting a high frequency voltage from the flyback controller the voltage is stepped down using a RF Pulse Transformer. They are intended to match impedances, isolate DC currents between circuits, and step down voltage. It has 3 windings - Primary, Secondary and Auxiliary.

6. Following the acquisition of the AC voltage, a half wave rectifier is used to convert the AC voltage to DC voltage. A 560 uF capacitor filters the DC voltage of the AC ripples  before being sent to the phone via a USB output.

*Our input AC voltage was rectified to DC voltage, and this DC was then converted back to AC at a higher frequency. After that, the AC was stepped down and rectified to produce the final DC output. One may wonder why we can't convert the AC input directly to the final DC output.* +
The size of the transformer is to blame. You would require a large transformer to step down to a lower voltage for the 220 V supply at a frequency of 50-60 Hz, which is an extremely low range, and this is not possible. Consequently, a high-frequency AC voltage is created with the aid of the flyback controller, which is then stepped down to a lower value by a transformer of an appropriate size.


*Usage of Wake-Up monitor (UCC24650)* +
The wake-up function operates in conjunction with the flyback controller (UCC28730). This feature permits light-load and no-load switching rates to approach 32 Hz to reduce losses but rouses the UCC28730 from its wait state (sleep mode) in the case of a major load step between power cycles. It is not necessary to have a large output capacitance despite the low frequencies in order to retain a good transient response. The UCC28730 monitors the VS input while it is in wait mode in case a wake-up signal arrives. When it does, it reacts instantly by executing a few high-frequency power cycles before resuming its operations in accordance with the control law to recover from the load-step transient and restore output voltage regulation.

== Design Cycle
=== Circuit Design 
The most fundamental part of designing a charger is its underlying circuit design. The Electrical Team of CADMUS attempted to design a circuit and tested it under various conditions to assess its feasibility. The circuit diagram for our attempt is shown below:

[.text-center]
_Figure 1. Circuit diagram for our charger_ 

The following is the output-voltage vs time curve for the circuit:

[.text-center]
_Figure 2. Simulation results on KiCAD_ 

As clearly visible, the circuit worked well, and it converged to the desirable output voltage of 5V quite quickly. However, it had a few drawbacks, so, we had to discard it.

.Drawbacks:
-	The frequencies at which this circuit would be operating would be around 50-60 Hz, which is relatively low. In our design, we require the use of a Step Down Transformer which would work at the said frequency. Such available transformers are usually quite large and bulky in size, and have low efficiency, that is, they generate a significant amount of heat. This would lead to thermal issues with the charger. 
-	The circuit is very unstable with respect to sudden variations/surges in current/voltage. It needs to be protected from the same using fuse resistors. This can lead to unexpected heating of the circuit which can damage the components and dissipate unnecessary heat in order to maintain constant output voltage.

Due to these reasons we started looking at SMPS circuits, which are not only much more energy efficient compared to linear regulators, but also allow for usage of smaller components. They are also capable of operating at a wide range of inputs.

After exploring on the web, we found a lot of SMPS circuits whose components would only allow a maximum current of 1 A, which is when we came across WEBENCH Power Designer by Texas Instruments. This gave us a circuit based on our requirements. We later verified if whether the components provided by the tool were fit for use or not, which was followed by PCB Design and Simulation.

=== Body Design

The charger design involves two critical aspects, including CAD model design and 3D printing. To improve our models, we took apart a pre-existing mobile charger to gain insights. Our improvements included adding a backside lid and attaching it with an adhesive, leaving space for metal prongs on the front side, and filleting sharp edges to avoid potential hazards. Additionally, we incorporated a Type C port on the back lid to allow for future connectivity and engraved our tribe's logo (CADMUS) on the top side to prevent copying. The use of a backside lid for analysis and the incorporation of a Type C port align with the increasing use of this technology in the future.

The size is sightly bugger than normal chargers as bigger PCB size which has almost no relation with the CAD model but is still a potential drawback for the model.
